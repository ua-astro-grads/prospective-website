							<p>
								You should have already received an elaborate guide to the Graduate Academic Program. Please take a careful look as it contains very important information! The info below is a brief summary. 
							</p>

							<h4>Department of Astronomy or Steward Observatory?</h4>

							<p>
								The Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Graduate Program is associated with both the Department of Astronomy and Steward Observatory. The Department of Astronomy denotes the academic side which teaches classes, hires faculty, etc. Steward Observatory is the name for the entity that manages the various telescopes and instruments across the electromagntic spectrum and world. They are closely intertwined and often referred to as "Arizona Astronomy", "Steward Observatory", or simply "Steward".

					<section id="funding" class="two">

								<h2>Funding</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								As a Steward graduate student, you are supported as either a Research Assistant (RA) or Teaching Assistant (TA) until you complete your PhD. Every Steward graduate student is paid the same, regardless of funding source. The department is aware that the living cost has increased noticeably since the COVID. So, there will be another salary raise for the academic year 25-26 (4 years in a row now, and one more planned in 2026*). This will bring graduate student salaries to $40,000 (before taxes) per year, which comes to ~$37,000 after taxes, depending on your exact financial situation. It should be noted that the pay is not distributed equally throughout the year. From August to April (academic semesters), the department will pay you ~$1100 every two weeks, but during the summer months, you are paid ~$2,200 every two weeks.
							</p>
							<p>
								Upon your arrival, you are given a $2,500 bonus stipend to spend at your own discretion on research related items such as books, a new laptop, conference expenses, etc. This bonus stipend does not have to be spent right away, but you cannot take it with you after you graduate.
							</p>
							<p>
								We are not required to TA during our first or second year, which means that we do not teach until we are done with our core classes. This is to make sure that students never have to juggle research, classes, and a TA-ship all at once. Note that we are required to do two semesters of TA-ing before graduating as part of the PhD program.
							</p>
							<p>
								As of 2024, the Graduate School has begun covering semesterly student fees that amounted to ~$800 a semester. These are fees that include library fees, financial aid trust fees, and recreation fees (gym, pool, etc.). This is huge for us! As it means ~$1600 more in our pockets each year. First years also receive a $3000 "travel advance" to cover moving expenses that comes out of your first summer pay (after your first year).

								<h2 >Research</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								At Steward, graduate students usually begin research immediately.  We have to do a "two year project" for our preliminary exam (described below). This project often continues into the thesis research, but students are encouraged to have broad interests. Students are allowed to change advisors at any time, or work with multiple advisors and postdocs. Steward grad students have access to a wide variety of resources: we can apply to all Steward telescopes (MMT, LBT, Magellan, Bok, etc.) as a Principle Investigator, our advisors have guaranteed time on multiple University supercomputers (in particular, Puma, Ocelote, and  El Gato), and faculty here are creating next-generation astronomy technology.

								<h2>Courses</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								As a student at Steward, you are required to successfully pass our 7 "core" courses in astronomy: Physics of Astrophysics, Computation &amp; Statistics, Cosmology, Stars &amp; Planets, Galaxies, ISM &amp; Star Formation, and Instrumentation. In addition, students are required to take another 8 graded credits of non-core courses. Core courses are taken during the first three semesters. The non-core requirement is usually fulfilled by choosing from a wide range of 3-credit elective classes and 1-2 credit seminars, typically offered in the Spring semesters. The non-core requirement can also be satisfied by taking courses offered by other departments, including Physics, Lunar and Planetary Sciences, Biology, Chemistry, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Optical Sciences.

								<h2>Advising and Mentoring</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								While you are visiting, you will be provided with numerous opportunities to meet with potential research advisors. If you end up talking to someone you'd really like to work with, don't hesitate to send a follow-up email expressing your interest! That way, if you decide to come here (which we hope you will!), you can get established with an advisor before you arrive and be ready to hit the ground running as soon as you get here. Please don't hesitate to ask current grad students for a candid opinion of various faculty members before choosing. 
							</p>
							<p>
								During recent years, students have been required to meet with a Mentoring Committee once a semester. First years are assigned Mentoring Committee members, but are free to choose their members for the remainder of their years. The function of the Mentoring Committee is to make sure that students have a broader range of faculty relationships in the department to facilitate their success in our program.
							</p>
							<p>
								In 2021, Steward graduate students and postdocs started The International Scholars Allyship Program. The program pairs an incoming International scholar with 2 Steward allies (1 international &amp; 1 domestic) to ease the new scholar's transition to living in America. The allies will help the new international student navigate through solving logistical hurdles (e.g., picking them up from the airport, helping them find housing &amp; reliable transportation to the university) while building a multicultural social community.
							</p>
							<p>
								In normal years, shortly after new grad students arrive in the fall, the department holds an Internal Research Symposium. At this symposium, various professors in the department give short talks about their research to help you find interesting advisors and/or projects. Within a month or so of arriving, you will be expected to select an advisor so that you can get started on research as early in your graduate career as possible.<br>

								<h2>The Preliminary Exam</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								The preliminary exam (a.k.a. prelim) consists of two tests, one written and one oral. There has been significant revision of the written portion starting from 21-22 academic year, following extensive consultation with our faculty and students. The new format is a closed-book exam based on class material. For each question, students will receive a grade of no revisions, minor revisions, or major revisions. It is given simultaneously to all second-year students during their 4th semester (Spring of the 2nd year). After this, you are encouraged to take the oral exam at the start of your 5th semester. During the oral exam, students give a presentation of their “two year project” in front of their Prelim Committee (which you choose at the start of your 3rd semester), which is followed by a Q&amp;A session. Most grad programs have some version of a prelim so it is a good idea to ask graduate students at all the programs you visit about their experience.

								<h2>Dissertation</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
								Once you pass the prelim you are on your way to the dissertation (Yay!). Some people change advisors and projects, some don't. The policy in recent years has been that the PhD should take you about 5-6 years, though some students take longer. Please ask the current grad students about their experience!

								<h2>Outreach</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
								There exists a wealth of outreach opportunities and inclusion initiatives at Steward. Most of the info can be found under the <a href="https://astro.arizona.edu/values" target="_blank">Values</a> tab on the Steward Website. We will be highlighting these programs during the visit, which will be recorded and available to you for ease of viewing after the visit ends.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is also a graduate student led initiative called <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sodei/" target="_blank">SODEI</a>  to build a more inclusive department for everyone by implementing actionable changes through five major task forces: (1) Admissions, (2) International Scholars, (3) Department Climate, (4) Mentoring, and (5) Recruiting and Retention.

							</p>
							<p>
								Steward grad students are involved in numerous outreach efforts as well, such as Astronomy on Tap (which we call "Space Drafts"), outreach to local K-12 schools, summer Astronomy Camp, and much more.
							</p>
							<p>
								Come to learn more about these at our sessions on Thursday!
