							<p>Congratulations on having been accepted to the Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics PhD program at the University of Arizona in Tucson!
							</p>

							<p>We’re really excited to welcome you to Tucson for our prospective visit! It's one of our favorite times of the year because we get to show off our world-class department and our lovely town to a new group of prospective students. Below you can find some information regarding our visit this year.
							</p>

							<p> If you want a tour of the University of Arizona and Steward Observatory before your actual visit, you can check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QvWC-sui9M&ab_channel=StewArdII">Tour of Steward Observatory</a> we put together for virtual visits during COVID. Huge thanks to Raphael for this one.</p>

								<h2>WHEN IS THE VISIT?</h2>
							</header>

							<p>The main visit will take place on <mark>March 18th - March 22nd (Wed-Sun)</mark>, with prospectives arriving Wednesday afternoon or evening and departing Sunday morning. If you are unable to make these dates, please email any of the organizers (contact information below) and we can try to schedule a different visit.

								<h2>WHAT TO EXPECT</h2>
							</header>

							<p>Here is a quick summary of what to expect on each day (sample schedule below). All meals will be provided.</p>

							<h4>Day 0 (Wednesday)</h4>
							<p>Whenever you arrive, your grad student host will pick you up from the airport and eventually take you out for dinner with other prospectives and grads (if possible).</p>

							<h4>Day 1 (Thursday)</h4>
							<p>We'll start with a Welcome to Steward message from Buell Jannuzi, our Director. Then, we'll have Faculty Science Talks where you will learn about the ground-breaking science being pursued here. After that, you'll have one-on-one meetings with current faculty members, giving preference to faculty with similar research interests, those you asked to meet, and those who asked to meet you. At lunch, you'll get to sit down with Grad students and the that week's colloquium speaker for Tamales. After lunch, you will receive a tour of the Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab and get to see some of the largest telescope mirrors in production! We just finished casting the last of the Giant Magellan Telescope mirrors. Finally, we (the grad students) will take everyone to dinner at various restaurants.
							</p>

							<h4>Day 2 (Friday)</h4>
							<p>First thing Friday, you'll learn about your Travel Reimbursement from the Steward Observatory Business Office (SOBO). Next, there will be an hour of student science talks before lunch and more meetings with current faculty members. The rest of the day will be spent with only grad students, who will host a round table on Living in Tucson as a Graduate Student, the various Outreach efforts in the Department, and dinner again. 
							</p>

							<h4>Day 3 (Saturday)</h4>
							<p>The last day of the visit will begin with brunch at the home of Buell Jannuzi, who is the head of the department, where you'll get a chance to really see our department culture up close and away from the office (and get to meet their amazing dogs, Nemi and Vardy). After that, you will explore what it is like to live in Tucson by participating in one of the activities listed in the survey (led by graduate students), and then wind down with a party in the evening before you fly back the next day!

								<h2>SAMPLE SCHEDULE</h2>

							<p>
								Below is a sample schedule for the visit days. While this won’t be exactly your schedule, since the faculty meetings will be with specific people and the schedule is subject to some change, it should give you a good sense of what to expect.

								<h2>1-on-1 Faculty Meetings</h2>
							</header>

							<p>Remember, WE are trying to recruit YOU! These meetings shouldn't be stressful. It's a chance for you to meet potential research advisors, learn about current research at Steward, and get to know the vibe of the department. If you ever find yourself not knowing what to ask, grad students here have kindly prepared a list of good questions! We've also provided a few similar lists that might be helpful:

								<h2>Grad Student Only Sessions</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
								We will have a few meetings where faculty will not be present. Here, we hope you’ll ask us current grad students all sorts of questions, especially ones that would be awkward to ask in front of faculty members. We usually know the department gossip and can tell you anything you want to know, like department culture, activities we like to do together, and life in Tucson.

								<h2>SLACK CHANNEL</h2>
							</header>

							<p>In addition to all of the meetings we will set up for you, we have created a slack channel for you! Check your email or contact one of the coordinators if you cannot find your invitation. This is a space where you can chat with current grad students to ask about the program, potential advisors, life in Tucson, or anything else.

								<h2>YOUR ORGANIZERS</h2>
							</header>

							<p> We are 3rd year graduate students at Steward: Noah Franz, Brock Parker, Brian Hsu, Junyu Zhang, Ningyuan Xu, and Aaron Goldtooth. This year, we are running the prospective visit. We hope this visit can give you a comprehensive preview of the science from our department and what it’s like to live in Tucson, AZ as a grad student. Spoiler, it's pretty great! If you need to get in touch with us, shoot us an email or send us a Slack message.
